<h1> Alan Fragoso </h1>
<h2> (aka AlanTheGreatest) </h2>
<p> I would consider myself as a gamer, who thinks way too highly of themselves, this can be seen by my username on almost all platforms, AlanTheGreatest. <br> I have recently been
getting into fashion and shoes, to me its a good way to express myself and show the confidence I have in myself. I am a Computer Science major looking to learn more about anything 
I can to broaden my knowledge.<br>  </p>
